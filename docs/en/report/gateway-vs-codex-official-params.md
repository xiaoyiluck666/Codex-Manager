# Current Differences from Official Codex

This document keeps only the remaining request-header differences that are still worth tracking.

## `/v1/responses` request headers

| Field | Official Codex | Current gateway | Difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Authorization` | `Bearer <official account token>` | `Bearer <current account token>` | The gateway replaces the account token |
| `User-Agent` | `codex_cli_rs/<compile-time version> (<os/version; <arch>) <terminal>` | `codex_cli_rs/<database-configured version> (<os/version; <arch>) <terminal>` | Official Codex uses `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`; the gateway currently reads this from a configurable database field |
| `x-client-request-id` | Always equals `conversation_id` | Prefer the thread anchor | When switching accounts or threads, it becomes the new thread anchor |
| `session_id` | Always equals `conversation_id` | Prefer the thread anchor | Not sent for normal `/responses` traffic when there is no thread anchor |
| `x-codex-turn-state` | Replayed within the same turn | Replayed while the same thread remains stable | Dropped proactively when switching accounts or replacing the thread |

## Current conclusion

1. These five request-header / transport-layer behaviors are still the main gaps worth tracking.
2. The `gatewayOriginator` setting is still stored locally, but it no longer affects the actual outbound `originator`. Outbound traffic now always uses the official default value: `codex_cli_rs`.
3. For `User-Agent`, official Codex uses the compile-time package version, while the current gateway allows the version segment to be configured from the database.
