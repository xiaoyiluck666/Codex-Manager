# SECURITY

## Support range

CodexManager We are still iterating rapidly, but we will try our best to deal with security issue reports within a reasonable range.

Priority issues include:

- Risk of leakage of account token, RPC token, and platform key
- Web Access password bypass
- Unauthorized access to local gateway
- Sensitive log leaks
- High-risk remote exploitation issues affecting desktop, service, and web terminals

## Reporting method

Please do not directly disclose reproducible sensitive vulnerability details, valid tokens or account data in public issues.

It is recommended to contact the maintainer privately via:

- GitHub Warehouse owner home page contact information
- Established private communication channels

If contact can only be made through Issues for the time being, please only describe the scope of impact and do not include:

- valid access token
- refresh token
- id token
- RPC token
- API key plain text
- Directly reusable attack scripts

## What we want to receive

Please try to provide:

1. Scope of influence
2. Reproduction steps
3. Trigger condition
4. expected results vs. actual results
5. Do you need to log in / Do you need local network conditions?
6. Log fragments or screenshots (note desensitization)

## Sensitive information handling conventions

Before submitting logs, screenshots, and configurations, please desensitize the following content:

- `Authorization` Head
- `Cookie`
- `Set-Cookie`
- `access_token`
- `refresh_token`
- `id_token`
- `CODEXMANAGER_RPC_TOKEN`
- Any directly reusable agent account or platform key

## Security constraints in the repository

- Do not submit real tokens, passwords, cookies, and API keys to the repository.
- Do not post sensitive values ​​that can be used directly in README, Issue, PR, or documents.
- When adding new logs, priority is given to recording structured context and plain text sensitive data is not output directly.
- When adding setting items, distinguish between "configurations suitable for persistence" and "sensitive values ​​that can only be provided in environment variables".

## Current known boundaries

- The project defaults to local deployment and self-hosted usage scenarios, and does not promise fully automatic security hardening when exposed to the public network.
- If `0.0.0.0` monitoring is enabled or Web/service is exposed to the LAN or public network, the deployer needs to bear the risk of network exposure at its own risk and cooperate with:
  - Strong password
  - Reverse proxy access control
  - network boundary restrictions

## Response Principles

- Issues that can be identified will be reproduced as much as possible and their impact levels assessed.
- After the repair is completed, it will be released in an appropriate version, and sensitive details will not be exposed in advance through public channels.
- If the problem does not belong to the repository itself, but to improper deployment configuration, a boundary description will also be given.
