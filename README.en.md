## Source Notes
> This project was built under my direction with AI assistance: Codex (98%) and Gemini (2%). If you run into issues while using it, please communicate in a friendly way. I open-sourced it because I thought it could help someone, and the core functionality is already usable.
> I also do not have enough environments to verify every package on every platform. I still have a day job, and I cannot afford devices like Macs, so I only guarantee availability for the Windows desktop app. If there are issues on other platforms, please report them in the community group or submit Issues after sufficient testing. I will handle them when I have time.
> Finally, thanks to everyone who reported platform-specific issues in the group and helped with part of the testing.

## Recent Changes
  - Current latest version: `v0.1.14` (2026-03-30)
  - This release closes out around two main goals: a more stable service and easier integration. The ingress layer now adds short queue waiting plus fast overload degradation, and the Settings page adds `System Derive` and `Single-account concurrency limit`, so any machine can queue first and degrade more safely instead of getting dragged down.
  - Plugin center support and integration docs continue to improve: the README now includes a plugin center preview image, and the minimal integration guide, full interface inventory, and system internal interface inventory are all in place, making external integration easier.
  - Long-term documentation has been normalized by removing date prefixes, and links in the README and docs have been updated to stable filenames for easier maintenance.
  - The scheduled script entry is now exposed on the Accounts page and runs once per minute by default, while users can still adjust it manually. The system internal interface inventory was also added to help hosts and plugins integrate.
  - This round of release alignment is also complete: the workspace, frontend package, Tauri desktop app, validation scripts, and README version notes have all been unified to `0.1.14`.

### Recent Commit Summary
- `8c9299f`: bumped the release version to `0.1.14`, aligning the workspace, frontend package, Tauri desktop app, and release validation scripts.
- `85022b9`: improved high-concurrency protection and documentation. The ingress layer now uses short queue waiting plus fast overload degradation, and the Settings page adds `System Derive` and a single-account concurrency limit.
- `a6a96d6`: added a plugin center preview image to the README. Both Chinese and English screenshot sections now include `plugin.png`.
- `ec03f2c`: removed date prefixes from long-term docs. Long-lived documents now use stable filenames, and multiple README links were updated accordingly.
- `927142a`: adjusted the default interval for the scheduled script. It now runs once per minute by default, while users can still customize it.
- `028c8c8`: added the scheduled script entry and the internal interface inventory. The Accounts page now includes the scheduled script entry, and docs now include the system interface inventory.
- `885edd0`: improved plugin center docs and onboarding. The minimal integration guide and full interface inventory are now complete.

## Feature Overview
- Account pool management: groups, tags, sorting, notes, ban detection, and banned-account filtering
- Bulk import / export: supports multi-file import, recursive JSON folder import on desktop, and single-file export per account
- Usage display: supports both 5-hour + 7-day dual windows and accounts that only return a 7-day single window, with the corresponding reset times shown
- Authorized login: browser authorization plus manual callback parsing
- Platform keys: create, disable, delete, model binding, reasoning effort, and service tier (`Follow Request` / `Fast` / `Flex`)
- Aggregate API: manage third-party minimal relay upstreams, with create, edit, connectivity testing, provider name, sort priority, and grouped display by Codex / Claude
- Plugin center: route at `/plugins/`, supports built-in curated, enterprise private, and custom-source market modes, and provides plugin lists, tasks, logs, and Rhai integration interfaces
- Settings page: supports the `System Derive` button, single-account concurrency limit, and a more conservative high-concurrency degradation strategy
- System internal interface inventory: lists all currently available desktop commands, service RPC methods, and plugin built-in functions
- Local service: auto-start, customizable port, and listen address
- Local gateway: provides one unified OpenAI-compatible endpoint for CLI tools and third-party tooling

## Quick Start
1. Launch the desktop app and click `Start Service`.
2. Go to `Account Management`, add an account, and complete authorization.
3. If callback parsing fails, paste the callback URL to complete parsing manually.
4. Refresh usage and confirm the account status.

## Default Data Directory
- By default, the desktop app writes the SQLite database to the app data directory, with the fixed filename `codexmanager.db`.
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\com.codexmanager.desktop\\codexmanager.db`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.codexmanager.desktop/codexmanager.db`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/com.codexmanager.desktop/codexmanager.db`
- If you need to adjust the database, proxy, listen address, or other runtime configuration, continue with [Environment Variables and Runtime Configuration](docs/report/环境变量与运行配置说明.md).

## Page Overview
### Desktop App
- Account Management: centrally import, export, and refresh accounts and usage, with low-quota / banned filters and reset-time display
- Platform Keys: bind platform keys by model, reasoning effort, and service tier, and view invocation logs
- Plugin Center: `/plugins/` route with built-in curated / enterprise private / custom-source market switching, plugin install, enable/disable, tasks, logs, and Rhai integration
- Settings: centrally manage ports, listen address, proxy, theme, auto-update, and background behavior

### Service Edition
- `codexmanager-service`: provides a local OpenAI-compatible gateway
- `codexmanager-web`: provides a browser management interface
- `codexmanager-start`: launches service + web with one command
